# Churn Customer Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers terminate their relationship with a company. Predicting churn can help companies take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about telecommunications customers, including demographic information, services subscribed, usage patterns, and churn status. The dataset consists of the following columns:

-State 
-Account length
-Area code
-International plan
-Voice mail plan
-Number vmail messages
-Total day minutes
-Total day calls
-Total day charge
-Total eve minutes
-Total eve calls
-Total eve charge
-Total night minutes
-Total night calls
-Total night charge
-Total intl minutes
-Total intl calls
-Total intl charge
-Customer service calls
-Churn (Target Variable)

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the data, understand the distribution of variables, and identify patterns and correlations.

3. **Feature Engineering**: New features may be created or existing features may be transformed to improve model performance.

4. **Model Selection**: Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting are trained and evaluated using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques such as ROC curve analysis may be used to assess model performance.

6. **Deployment**: The best-performing model is deployed to production for real-time prediction of customer churn.

## Running the Code

To reproduce the results of this analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/churn-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy
   pip install panda
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install seaborn
   pip install -U scikit-learn
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook churn_prediction_analysis.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each code cell and analyze the results.

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of 91.4% and outperforms baseline models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. By identifying customers at risk of churn, the company can implement targeted retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
